## Project Description

This project was developed as part of the Junior AI/ML Developer technical assessment.

The application is designed to store the patient blood test information and generate AI-based health remarks using an external health prediction API. It provides a simple interface for managing patient records and viewing health risk predictions.

The system allows users to add, view, update, and delete patient information while storing the data in a database for the future access.
